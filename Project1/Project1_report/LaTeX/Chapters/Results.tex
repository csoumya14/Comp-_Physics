\chapter{Results}
\label{chap:Results}
%Include your results either in figure form or in a table. Remember to label your results.
%All tables and figures should have relevant captions and labels on the axes.
When running the code presented in \chapref{chap:method} with different number of grid points $n$'s, corresponding to different step lengths $h$, the value of the numerical solution for an arbitrary $x_i$ will be different, as well.
This is due to the fact, that a decrement or increment of the step length will change the precision of the result. 
This chapter strives to consider what happens to the precision of the numerical solution as the number of grid points is changed from $n=10$ to $n=100$ and $n=1,000$. 

In the final part of the following section, the relative error is plotted as a function of $\log(h)$, and in this part the number of grid points is increased to $n=10,000$ and $n=100,000$.

The results from running the code with $10$, $100$, $1,000$, $10,000$, and $100,000$ grid points can be found in the GitHub folder  \fxnote{linkt to Github-address}.
