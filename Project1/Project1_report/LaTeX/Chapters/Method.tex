\chapter{Method}
\label{chap:method}
This chapter provides argumentation for why the Poisson equation can be solved numerically using a linear set of equations. 
Thereafter, the algorithm for solving the problem is discussed, and the number of \flops \, in this algorithm is compared to the number of \flops \, in the ordinary Gaussian elimination and LU decomposition method.
